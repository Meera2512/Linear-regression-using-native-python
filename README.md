Linear regression using native python
'' ABOUT THE DATASET:

NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel. The data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments. The data set has 6 attributes as given below. Now we will read a dataset for Machine Learning using pandas filename = "airfoil_self_noise.dat.txt" This is tab separated file with no headers Use appropriate command to read this data file and store the data into dataframe. After that convert it to numpy Then use numpy to split the data into training and test set. The training data should have 80% of data, and the test data should ahve 20% data.

Details of Data set: Attribute Information:

This problem has the following inputs: (Attributes 1 to 5 form X_data)

Frequency, in Hertzs.
Angle of attack, in degrees.
Chord length, in meters.
Free-stream velocity, in meters per second.
Suction side displacement thickness, in meters.
The only output is (and Y_data):

Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels. '''
